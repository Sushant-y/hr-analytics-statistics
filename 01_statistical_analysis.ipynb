    "Purpose\n",
    "This notebook presents statistics and pobability focused analysis of HR analytics dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to determine correct statistical reasoning, appropriate test selection,\n",
    "explicit assumprtions checks, and correct interpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an observational dataset no casual claimns are made."

    "\n",
    "The dataset contains employee-level HR information collected through routine\n",
    "organizational processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important implications:\n",
    "- The data is observational, not experimental\n",
    "- There is no random assignment or intervention\n",
    "- Statistical results reflect associations only\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, techniques such as A/B testing and causal inference are not applicable."

    "- Continuous numerical\n",
